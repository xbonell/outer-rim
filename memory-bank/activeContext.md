# Active Context

## Current Focus

- **Setup Status**: Core infrastructure is configured and webhook system is working
- **Security**: Comprehensive security checklist and setup script available
- **Configuration**: Docker Compose with nginx-proxy and acme-companion ready
- **SSL Automation**: Cron-based certificate renewal system implemented
- **Current Issues**: 
  - Missing site content (sites/xbonell.com/dist directory empty)
  - Environment file needs proper configuration
- **Next Steps**: Deploy and configure first site, validate SSL setup for xbonell.com
- **Recent Success**: Webhook system fully functional with HTTPS access and automatic renewal

## Technical Context

### Working Components
- ✅ nginx-proxy with custom configuration support
- ✅ acme-companion for SSL certificate generation
- ✅ Native webhook service with Docker host routing
- ✅ Custom nginx configuration for non-Docker services
- ✅ Manual SSL certificate generation process
- ✅ Automated certificate renewal system (cron-based)

### Architecture Pattern
- **Hybrid Setup**: Docker containers for main services, native service for webhook
- **Custom Routing**: nginx-proxy with custom configuration files
- **SSL Management**: Automatic for Docker services, automated manual for native services
- **Automation**: Cron-based certificate renewal with monitoring and logging
