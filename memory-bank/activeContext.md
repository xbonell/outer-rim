# Active Context

## Current Focus

- **Setup Status**: Core infrastructure is configured, webhook system removed (July 28, 2025)
- **Security**: Comprehensive security checklist and setup script available
- **Configuration**: Docker Compose with nginx-proxy and acme-companion ready
- **Architecture**: Simplified setup with GitHub Actions deployment
- **Current Issues**: 
  - Missing site content (sites/xbonell.com/dist directory empty)
  - Environment file needs proper configuration
- **Next Steps**: Deploy and configure first site, validate SSL setup for xbonell.com
- **Recent Success**: Webhook infrastructure successfully removed with zero impact on existing services

## Technical Context

### Working Components
- ✅ nginx-proxy with custom configuration support
- ✅ acme-companion for SSL certificate generation
- ✅ Docker Compose configuration (webhook services removed)
- ✅ Custom nginx configuration for non-Docker services
- ✅ Manual SSL certificate generation process
- ✅ Simplified architecture with GitHub Actions deployment

### Architecture Pattern
- **Docker-Focused Setup**: Docker containers for main services
- **Custom Routing**: nginx-proxy with custom configuration files
- **SSL Management**: Automatic for Docker services via acme-companion
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment
- **Maintenance**: Reduced complexity with webhook infrastructure removed

## Recent Task Completion

### Webhook Infrastructure Removal (July 28, 2025)
- **Status**: ✅ ARCHIVED
- **Impact**: Simplified architecture, reduced maintenance burden
- **Files Removed**: 7 webhook-related files
- **Documentation**: README.md updated to reflect GitHub Actions deployment
- **Manual Actions**: DNS record removal, nginx-proxy restart pending
- **Archive**: `memory-bank/archive/archive-webhook-removal-2025-07-28.md`

## Next Task Preparation

The system is now ready for the next task. The webhook infrastructure removal has been completed and archived, leaving a clean, simplified architecture focused on Docker-based services with GitHub Actions deployment.

**Ready for**: VAN mode to begin next task
