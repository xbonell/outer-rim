## ‚úÖ Completed Issues

### 1. Webhook Routing Issue (RESOLVED)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed
- **Issue**: Webhook service running natively on host, not accessible via nginx-proxy
- **Solution**: Custom nginx configuration with manual SSL certificate generation
- **Result**: `curl -X POST https://webhook.xbonell.com/hooks/test` now works

### 2. Webhook SSL Certificate Automation (RESOLVED)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented
- **Issue**: Manual certificate generation requires automation for renewal
- **Solution**: Cron-based renewal script with monitoring
- **Implementation**: 
  - `scripts/renew-webhook-cert.sh` - Automated renewal script
  - `scripts/check-webhook-cert.sh` - Certificate monitoring script
  - Daily cron job for automatic checks
  - Logging to `logs/webhook-cert-renewal.log`
- **Result**: Automatic SSL certificate renewal for webhook.xbonell.com

## üö® Critical Issues

### 3. Environment Configuration
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs attention
- **Issue**: .env file needs proper LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL configuration
- **Action**: Run setup.sh and configure email address
- **Priority**: High

### 4. Site Content Deployment
- **Status**: ‚ùå Not started
- **Issue**: sites/xbonell.com/dist directory is empty
- **Action**: Deploy site content to enable the configured service
- **Priority**: High

## üìã Setup & Deployment

### 5. SSL Certificate Automation Setup
- [x] Create `scripts/renew-webhook-cert.sh` with automatic renewal logic
- [x] Create `scripts/check-webhook-cert.sh` for certificate monitoring
- [ ] Set up cron job for daily certificate checks
- [ ] Test automation with certificate expiration simulation
- [ ] Add logging and alerting for certificate issues

### 6. Initial Deployment
- **Status**: ‚è≥ Ready to start
