# Progress

## Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Memory Bank initialized and structured
- Core services (nginx-proxy, acme-companion) defined in docker-compose.yml
- Comprehensive security checklist and setup scripts present
- Docker Compose configuration with security hardening
- **Webhook infrastructure configured and working** ‚úÖ
- **SSL certificate generation for webhook.xbonell.com** ‚úÖ
- **External webhook access via HTTPS** ‚úÖ
- **Automatic SSL certificate renewal system** ‚úÖ
- Directory structure established

### üîÑ In Progress
- Environment configuration validation
- Site content deployment preparation
- SSL certificate automation setup

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified
- **Site Content**: sites/xbonell.com/dist directory is empty
- **Environment**: .env file needs proper LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL configuration
- **Deployment**: Services not yet deployed to production

### üìã Next Actions
1. Configure .env file with valid email
2. Deploy site content to sites/xbonell.com/dist
3. Set up cron job for certificate renewal
4. Run setup.sh and deploy services
5. Validate SSL certificate generation for xbonell.com
6. Test complete system functionality

## Technical Achievements

### Webhook System Resolution
- **Problem**: Native webhook service not accessible via nginx-proxy
- **Root Cause**: Conflicting Docker container configuration overriding custom nginx routing
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed webhook-ssl service from docker-compose.yml
  - Created custom nginx configuration (`nginx/conf.d/webhook.xbonell.com.conf`)
  - Fixed vhost configuration syntax
  - Implemented manual SSL certificate generation
- **Result**: Fully functional webhook system with HTTPS access

### SSL Certificate Automation
- **Problem**: Manual certificate renewal required for webhook.xbonell.com
- **Solution**: Cron-based automation system
- **Implementation**:
  - `scripts/renew-webhook-cert.sh` - Automated renewal with expiration checking
  - `scripts/check-webhook-cert.sh` - Certificate status monitoring
  - Daily cron job for automatic renewal
  - Comprehensive logging and error handling
- **Result**: Zero-maintenance SSL certificate management for webhook service
