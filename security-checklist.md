# Security Checklist for Outer Rim

## Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Create `.env` file from `env.example`
- [ ] Use a dedicated email for Let's Encrypt notifications
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Change the default email address in `.env`
- [ ] Set strong passwords for any database services
- [ ] Review and update all environment variables
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data is hardcoded in docker-compose.yml

### File Permissions
- [ ] Set proper permissions on nginx directories:
  ```bash
  chmod 755 nginx/
  chmod 600 nginx/certs/
  chmod 644 nginx/conf.d/
  ```
- [ ] Ensure `.env` file has restricted permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod 600 .env
  ```

### Network Security
- [ ] Configure firewall rules:
  ```bash
  # Allow only necessary ports
  ufw allow 80/tcp
  ufw allow 443/tcp
  ufw enable
  ```
- [ ] Consider using a reverse proxy (like Cloudflare) for additional protection

### SSL/TLS Configuration
- [ ] Test SSL configuration with:
  ```bash
  curl -I https://your-domain.com
  ```
- [ ] Verify certificate renewal is working
- [ ] Check SSL Labs rating: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/

## Runtime Security Monitoring

### Log Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor nginx access logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Check certificate renewal logs
- [ ] Review Docker container logs regularly

### Container Security
- [ ] Regularly update Docker images
- [ ] Monitor container resource usage
- [ ] Check for container vulnerabilities

### Network Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor network traffic patterns
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection if needed
- [ ] Review firewall logs

## Regular Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks
- [ ] Review security logs
- [ ] Check for Docker image updates
- [ ] Verify certificate status

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Update all Docker images
- [ ] Review and update security headers
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Review access logs for patterns

### Quarterly Tasks
- [ ] Security audit of configuration
- [ ] Update SSL/TLS configuration
- [ ] Review and update firewall rules
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedures

## Incident Response

### Security Breach Response
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Stop affected services
   - Isolate compromised containers
   - Preserve logs and evidence

2. **Investigation**
   - Review access logs
   - Check for unauthorized changes
   - Identify attack vector

3. **Recovery**
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Update security configurations
   - Monitor for recurrence
